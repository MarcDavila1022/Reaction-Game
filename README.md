# Reaction-Game
This is my third project experimenting more with the turtle module and learning more on the time module.
Marc Davila, reaction game

I created this game to continue to learn about turtle on my own and to test reactions time after 20 seconds.
A lot of my code is made to train the hand eye coordination in a untraditional way.
First, most hand eye coordination use the color red since our brain reacts to it the fastest.
Second, I did not use a timer since it causes time anxiety and might change the results.
Time anxiety might make the player speed up when the timer winds down and we want the user to naturally
get better. However, we have to remember that the results would not be that drastic and that in the span of 20 seconds,
the average speed will be less than in one second. For that reason, we have to first get a median.
